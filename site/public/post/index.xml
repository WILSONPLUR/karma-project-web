The Chemex Coffeemaker is a manual, pour-over style glass-container coffeemaker that Peter Schlumbohm invented in 1941, and which continues to be manufactured by the Chemex Corporation in Chicopee, Massachusetts*.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1958, designers at the &lt;a href="https://www.spacefarm.digital">Illinois Institute of Technology&lt;/a> said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is &lt;em>&amp;ldquo;one of the best-designed products of modern times&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Just in: small batch of Jamaican Blue Mountain in store next week</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/jamaica-blue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2017 15:04:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/jamaica-blue/</guid><description>&lt;p>We expect the shipment of a limited quantity of green beans next Monday.

The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
